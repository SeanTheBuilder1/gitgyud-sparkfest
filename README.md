# QSee - Complaints, Requests, Volunteering

## 📌 Project Overview

QSee is a web-based platform designed to bridge the communication gap between QCitizens and the Quezon City Local Government Unit (LGU). It serves as a centralized and transparent medium for reporting civic issues such as poor infrastructure, unorganized commute routes, public health concerns, safety issues, and corruption.

Through QSee, verified citizens can post, comment, and track local concerns in a public space. The Quezon City LGU acts as administrators, responding to reports as a sign of transparency and responsible governance. The system also supports volunteering features, interactive mapping, and admin-friendly dashboards powered by AI.
